# This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The main objective of this project was to create a burger-app applying my knowledge in React and Adding a CSS Modules Stylesheet.

Basically it consists in getting the order of a hamburger where the price is increased by adding each of the desired ingredients.
There is still a lot of functionality that I am about to include.

In the not so distant future I will add good styles to be a more pleasant application to the public eye, while I will continue my studies with React.

If you want you can see the app in the following [link](https://luismgil.github.io/my-burger-app/).
